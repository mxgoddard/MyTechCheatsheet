### Gulp.js

[Gulp Website](https://gulpjs.com/)

Gulp.js is a toolkit for JavaScript that allows you to automate repetive workflows into a more efficient build pipeline. I've mainly seen it used to minify code (using [Uglify.js](#uglify)) when the project compiles.

### Uglify.js

[Uglify Page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglify-js)

- A package for minifying code (The names uglify and minify are synonymous).
- Only supports ECMAScript 5 (ES5, 2011). For ES6 (2015) and more recent (up to ES11 in 2020), use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

## Ideas

- Move page onto a website
- Bla
- Blaa
- Blaaa

## Notes

- Make sure information is relevant and not unecessary (anecdotes).
- Don't need to list absolutely everything, but information that is helpful for me.
